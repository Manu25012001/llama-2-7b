# LLaMA 2 from Scratch

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the **LLaMA 2 architecture** from scratch. It builds on the principles of the Transformer model and is designed to load checkpoints from the original LLaMA model. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how the LLaMA architecture works, enabling further research, fine-tuning, and custom applications for AI models.

## Features

- Implementation of **LLaMA 2 architecture** from scratch.
- Customizable hyperparameters for  inference.
- Support for **loading LLaMA checkpoints** to continue  inference.
- Utilizes **PyTorch** as the backend deep learning framework.
- Optimized for large-scale data processing and training on GPUs.
- Extensible and modular design for experimenting with various model parameters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama2-from-scratch.git
   cd llama2-from-scratch
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download LLaMA checkpoints and place them in the `checkpoints/` directory.



## Inference

Once trained or after loading a pre-trained checkpoint, you can perform inference with:

```bash
python src/infer.py--checkpoint checkpoints/llama_checkpoint.pt
```

This will output a generated text based on the model's understanding.

## Checkpoints

To use pre-trained LLaMA checkpoints, download them from the official source and place them in the `checkpoints/` folder. You can also save your own checkpoints during training and reload them for further training or inference.

## Customization

You can modify the model architecture, training loop, or tokenization logic in the `src/` directory based on your requirements. The model is designed to be flexible and modular to accommodate various experimental setups.
